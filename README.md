# The-Even-More-Perfect-Calculator
It's like a calculator but better

# How To Use
 1) Download `generator.js`
 
 2) Open up `generator.js` and modify the `max` value to suit your needs
 
 3) Run the generator: `node generator.js` (This could take some time)
 
 4) Open up `interface.html` to use your new calculator
